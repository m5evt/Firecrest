# Firecrest
This project is a dual band band HF CW transceiver design with a focus on portable operating. The design is realised across 3 stacked PCBs and the receiver is very similar to the N7VE/Norcal NC2030 and the transmitter PA is very similar to the KD1JV series of MTR rigs. This is not a kit, I intend to write a set of instruction to allow someone else with the appropriate skills to source their own components and build this radio.
